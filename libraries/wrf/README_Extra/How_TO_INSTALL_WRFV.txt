%%%This Will Guide you through the setup process for WRFV version 3.1.1

%%Before you do this make sure you have the following
programs

Program List
1. m4
2. csh
3. C and C++ (test this by typing in gcc and g++)
4. gfortran
%%Automatically installed by Ubuntu
5. bash
6. sh
7. perl
8. gunzip
9. tar

%If you don't have these programs then you need to install them using synaptic package manager or sudo apt-get install(if using ubuntu)

%%Installation Guide

1. Download netcdf-bin using synaptic package manager (System-Administration-Synaptic Package Manager)
   Notes: if it downloads successfully you should be able to type in ncdump but not nc-config

   you might also want to make sure that ncdump is located in /usr/bin/ that way when you do the manual install
   everything will work well

   to check and make sure that ncdump is located in the /usr/bin/ folder type the following commands

   cd /usr/bin/

   ./ncdump

   if it says "no such file or directory" something went wrong

2. Now go to this website and download the rest of net-cdf andideal.exe              tr49t67
 do a manual install. I downloaded net-cdf 4.0.1

   http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/netcdf-4_0_1/index.jsp    (MAKE SURE TO DOWNLOAD THE .gz VERSION)

   this will download a .gz so you need to type the following commands
 
   cd (directory of downloaded file)

   gunzip (netcdf file)

   tar -xvf (netcdf file)

   cd (netcdf folder)

   To do the manual install you can either:

   A. open the INSTALL file and read how to do it or
   B. type the following command
      
   sudo ./configure --prefix="/usr/"

   To make sure that everything installed correctly type

   sudo make check install

   If it works it should say CONGRATULATIONS blah blah blah

   Last thing to check is to make sure that nc-config exists and that it is located in the /usr/bin folder

3. Now we must set some environment variables, type the following

   export NETCDF=/usr/

   then type env to and make sure the variable was created,then open up your profile file. (Note: when you set an environment variable it only sets it in the terminal    window that you have open. if you close that terminal window you need to redeclare all the environment variables...lame. which is why we are putting the variables in the profile file that way when you log in all the env variables are automatically set)

   Anyway to open up the profile file the following command will work

   sudo nano /etc/profile

   somewhere in the file type in:

   export NETCDF=/usr/

   then to close the file type CTRL-X and then it will ask you if you want to save. type Y for yes.

   This will guarantee that the environment variable is set everytime you boot your computer

4. Now we are ready to compile WRFV

   So go to this website and download WRFV3. Go down to the bottom of the page and click "New Users"

   http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/download/get_source.html
   (This is also a great website for documentation and forums)

   You must create a username and password to access it

   I downloaded WRFV3.1.1

   again use the gunzip and tar commands to extract the folder (make sure you extract the folder into a place that makes sense)

   Now once you have the WRFV folder extracted cd into the folder and type ./clean -a then ./configure

   I usually pick selection 1(but I would pick the gcc or the gfortran compiler) with no nesting

   Then type 

   ./compile   

   a list of options will pop up, to test it type

   ./compile em_b_wave >& wave.log

   This compile usually takes about 10 minutes to compile

   The extra > will write everything to the log file so when the compilation is over open up the wave.log file
   and check and see if any errors exist.

4.5 To compile the code by typing in one command you need the code CreateCode which I created.
    It prompts the user for the compilation and just takes out some unnecessary steps.

   ./CreateCode

   pick your selection for configuring. it then asks you which code to compile and thats it   

5. Now if everything worked you should be able to do the following

   cd into a folder called run/ and see two files ideal.exe and wrf.exe

   first open up namelist.input to change the input configuration then run ./ideal.exe and then ./wrf.exe


   If something didn't work 

   ./clean -a 

   then run ./configure with different options and see if that works
