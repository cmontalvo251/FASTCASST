THIS FILE WILL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN CHANGE ABOUT
THE WIND MODELING CODE

%%%%%This will explain the namelist.input and input_sounding 
file as well as possible.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%RUN TIME%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Specify the run time and start time then make sure that
the end time matches up

 run_days                            = 0,
 run_hours                           = 0,
 run_minutes                         = 20,
 run_seconds                         = 0,
 start_year                          = 0001,
 start_month                         = 01,
 start_day                           = 01,
 start_hour                          = 00,
 start_minute                        = 00,
 start_second                        = 00,
 end_year                            = 0001,
 end_month                           = 01,
 end_day                             = 01,
 end_hour                            = 00,
 end_minute                          = 20,
 end_second                          = 00,

%%%%%OUTPUT DATA PARAMETER%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The history interval is in minutes and outputs the data every
history_interval minutes.

 history_interval                    = 1,

if you want to output in seconds change the history_interval 
to history_interval_m and history_interval_s

 history_interval_m                  = 01,
 history_interval_s                  = 00,

%%%%%%%% TIMESTEP %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The timestep is in seconds(recommend 6*dx(km))

 time_step                           = 20,

%%%%%%OUTPUT DOMAIN SIZE PARAMETERS%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

These are domain parameters. Essentially how big the 
matrices are. e_we is the number of columns and e_vert 
is the number of rows

 s_we (max_dom)                      = 1,	; start index in x (west-east) direction (leave as is)
 e_we (max_dom)                      = 91,	; end index in x (west-east) direction
 s_sn (max_dom)                      = 1,	; start index in y (south-north) direction (leave as is)
 e_sn (max_dom)                      = 82,	; end index in y (south-north) direction
 s_vert (max_dom)                    = 1,	; start index in z (vertical) direction (leave as is)
 e_vert (max_dom)                    = 28,	; end index in z (vertical) direction

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%GRID SIZE%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The following specify the grid size for the output data in 
meters. ztop is the maximum height which in this case is 30km. Of course
if you change these parameters make sure to change the timestep accordingly
Actually don't ever change ztop unless you are running LES. 

 dx                                  = 2000,
 dy                                  = 2000,
 ztop                                = 30000.,

if you change ztop you must change the input_sounding file
The timestep is in seconds(recommend 6*dx(km))

%%%%%%%%INPUT_SOUNDING FILE%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

the format is as follows

this is the first line

surface_pressure(hPa)  surface_temp(K) moisture_mixing ratio(g/kg)

the rest is define as follows. thus you need to make sure you
have enough data points for this
height(m) temp(K) mixing_ratio(g/kg) x-wind(m/s) y-wind(m/s)

%%%%%%%%%%TOPOGRAPHY%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To change the topography go into the file 
~/dyn_em/module_initialize_[case].F where [case] is the current 
case you are running and on about line 289 change the value
grid%ht to whatever you want.

%make sure that terrain data is square if you add an external
terrain_data.txt

if you want just flat terrain just delete the terrain_data.txt file in the run/ folder

%%%%%%%%%%VARIABLES IN module_initialize_[case].F%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

grid%ht = the terrain height in meters
its = s_we from namelist.input 
ite = e_we from namelist.input
jts = s_sn from namelist.input
jte = e_sn from namelist.input
ids = s_we from namelist.input 
ide = e_we from namelist.input
jds = s_sn from namelist.input
jde = e_sn from namelist.input
g = gravity in m/s^2

%%%%RESTART RUNS%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Consult the WRF_user_guide page 92 to learn about
this. This allows you to start a run and create a save 
point. Allowing you to quit the program and continue from
where you left off. I would write it here but it is pretty
straight forward

%%%%%%%%PHYSICS PARAMETERS%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

 &physics
 mp_physics                          = 0, ; rain,ice, and snow (I usually pick 2)
 ra_lw_physics                       = 0, ; accounts for gases (1)
 ra_sw_physics                       = 0, ; accounts for cloude (1)
 radt                                = 0, ; ??
 sf_sfclay_physics                   = 0, ; viscous sub layers (1)
 sf_surface_physics                  = 0, ; Don't use this one
 bl_pbl_physics                      = 0, ; 
 bldt                                = 0,

 ifsnow                              = 0,
 icloud                              = 1,
 num_soil_layers                     = 5,

All of these parameters can be changed. Consult the WRF_user_guide
for detailed explanations. page 104

%%%%%%%%%%%LARGE EDDY SIMULATION STUFF%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The surface heat flux is in the namelist.input file and is written
as tke_heat flux. As shown below.

 tke_heat_flux                       = 0.24,   0.24,   0.24,

The units are in Watts/m^2 where a Watt = Joule/s = N*m/s

Also it takes 30 minutes of simulation time to accurately capture
well established turbulence. So it might be a good idea to 
simulate for 30 minutes then take the wind at 30 minutes as the 
initial conditions

%%%%OTHER F FILES%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Sometimes if your timestep is too large you get NANs. I edited
a few routines to add in a test for NANs. No one likes to run code for
hours and just get a bunch of garbage.
