%%%This will guide you through the setup of installing NCL 
post processing on your computer

1. Go to the following website and create an account

http://www.earthsystemgrid.org/

once there you need to click on NCAR Command Language and proceed to download.

I downloaded version 5.2.0 (make sure to download the precompiled binaries)

It will then ask you to subscribe to an elite mailing list. Subscribe, logout, and log back in
and you should be able to download a file.

If you're running Linux like I am you need to figure out the version of gcc and linux that you have

to figure out which precomplied binary version to download, type the following commands

   uname -m

   gcc --version

I get the following

   i686

   gcc version 4.3.2

Thus the version of NCL I downloaded is called 

   ncl_ncarg-5.2.0.Linux_i686_gcc432.tar.gz

If you can't find a precompiled binary that means they haven't compiled NCL for your distribution and thus you will have to compile it by yourself. Good luck. I've never tried that.

2. Now we can install the software.

first we need to use gunzip to unzip the file

   gunzip ncl_ncarg-5.2.0.Linux_i686_gcc432.tar.gz

Then we need to figure out where to put the file. It creates a bin, lib, 
and include directory so I put it in /usr/ since these directories already 
exist, thus I type in the command

   cd /usr/
   sudo tar -xvf ~/(Directory of File)/ncl_ncarg-5.2.0.Linux_i686_gcc432.tar

This should have created all of the libraries in the /usr folder. If you want to be sure type in

   cd /usr/bin/

   ./ncargcc

   if something pops up besides command not found then you're OK

3. Now that the software is installed we need to create some environment variables

type the following commands

   export NCARG_ROOT=/usr/   

then type 

   env 	  

to make sure that the environment variable is created. Furthermore check the PATH environment variable.
If /usr/bin/ is not in the PATH variable then type the following commands, else don't worry about it.

   export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH 

Now to make sure that these environment variables are set everytime you start up the computer you must make
sure that the commands are listed in your profile file type in

   sudo nano /etc/profile

and include the export commands in this file

Finally make sure that the DISPLAY environment variable is set to 

   :0.0

4. Now it's time to test and make sure that NCL installed properly.

First make sure you have csh installed. to test this type

   csh

This is just another shell enviroment so if it works you should just enter another shell. type

  exit 

to exit the shell

To test the ncl program cd into your home directory and type

  ng4ex gsun01n

A window should pop up with some graphics on it. this file copies the gsun01n.ncl file into your home 
directory. From now on you can type

  ncl gsun01n.ncl 

to run the same program. 

---------EVERYTHING BELOW HERE IS NOT REALLY NECESSARY----------------

Now to test the graphics type 

  ncargex cpex08 -clean

5. Problems

when I run

  ncargex cpex08 -clean

I get the error message

  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lX11
  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

To fix this problem I typed 

  locate libX11.so

and it returned

  /usr/lib/libX11.so.6
  /usr/lib/libX11.so.6.2

So I created a symbolic link in that file. The next two commands should work

  cd /usr/lib/
  sudo ln -s libX11.so.6 libX11.so

Now ncargex should work. If you get another error like cannot find
something. Just do a locate command and then a link command and it should fix it.


6. I would recommend creating a .hluresfile to your home directory, this file customizes fonts and what not

!=========================================
! This is a sample .hluresfile. It should
! go in your home directory.
!
! Comments for ".res" files are preceded by a "!".
! Remember quotations are not used in .res files.

! White background/black foreground
*wkForegroundColor  : (/0.,0.,0./)
*wkBackgroundColor  : (/1.,1.,1./)

! Have a favorite colormap that you use for everything? You can
! make it your default here (note the name is NOT in quotes).
!
! For all available color maps, see 
! http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Document/Graphics/color_table_gallery.shtml
! *wkColorMap         : rainbow+gray

! Font
*Font           : helvetica 

! Function Codes [Default is a colon]
*TextFuncCode               : ~     
 
! Make default X11 window larger (adjust as necessary)
*wkWidth                     : 800
*wkHeight                    : 800

! Increase the default (16mb) contour memory
! For example, if you have gridded data that
! is larger than 500 x 500, you may need this.
*wsMaximumSize: 32556688
