The following files have directions on how to download, compile, 
and run the WRF software.

First you need to download and compile WRFV.

1.) Read HOW_TO_INSTALL_WRFV.txt

The WRFV software outputs an extremely odd file format that
needs to be processed using NCL (NCAR Programming Language)

2.) Read HOW_TO_INSTALL_NCL.txt

NCL is a coding language just like any other. If you'd like to learn how to write in NCL you can download some manuals are you can just read my readme - NCL_CODE_HELP.txt but it isn't necessarily mandatory for you to know how to code in NCL.

Alright now we have WRFV downloaded and WRFV installed. Now it's time to customize the code and take a look at the input files.

3.) Read THINGS_YOU_CAN_CHANGE.txt

Ok now you sort of understand how to change some input files but how do you run the code and process the data.

4.) Read EXAMPLE_WRF_SIM_START2FINISH.txt
