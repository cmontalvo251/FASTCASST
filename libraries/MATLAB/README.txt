Here are the cpp and h files necessary to use the MATLAB class.

There is a file called test_MATLAB_class.cpp.test that you can remane to 
extension .cpp and compile to try and test the class however it is old
and therefore does not really work. 

There is also a testtimer.cpp.test which is used to test the timer
class
