# Navio
I took all of the Navio files from Emlid and add some extra functionality to them

####FOR ARDUINO###
For information on installing libraries, see: http://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries

Don't do that. First you need to open up the Arduino INO
File->Preferences and make sure your sketchbook folder is set to FASTKit/

This will point the Arduino software over to this library folder which has all of the 
libraries needed for arduino

Hopefully there is already a libraries folder in the src directory. If you're reading
this it obviously exists.
