For whatever reason I couldn't get the Arduino IDE to accept the folder structure of the vehicles/ folder. So right now the forces.* is in here since Arduino doesn't need it and there is a quadcopter_controller/ folder that is imported by the Arduino IDE. It's possible you'll need to put all the control systems in the libraries folder and then the config and force models in the vehicles folder. Perhaps you can just put the entire vehicles/ folder in the libraries folder for consistency.
