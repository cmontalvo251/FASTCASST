/* Forces Template 2021

This forces file is a template for a fictitious portalcube
with thrusters and a simple aero model. The Dynamics.cpp module
will call a few candidate functions. If you make your own aero
file with header and cpp file you must conform to the following
functions otherwise the software will completely break.

#include "forces.h"

//Constructor
forces::forces() {
  //The constructor must create these 3x1 vectors
  FB.zeros(3,1,"Force in Body Frame");
  MB.zeros(3,1,"Moment in Body Frame");
}

void forces::ForceMoment(double time,MATLAB state,MATLAB statedot,int pwm_array[],environment env) {
  //The only thing this function needs to do is populate FB and MB. 
  //You can do whatever you want in here but you must create those two vectors.
  FB.mult_eq(0); //Zero these out just to make sure something is in here
  MB.mult_eq(0);
